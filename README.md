# Recycling Educational Game <sup>(or as we like to call it: _AI Rec-Connects_)</sup>

Welcome to the Recycling Educational Game project! This is a simple educational game aimed at promoting trash recycling among 12-13 year olds in the Middle East. The game is currently a proof of concept and needs further development and tidying. This was made as part of the AI Connects event held in Berlin in collaboration with the GIU from the 15th to 25th of July, 2024. Huge thanks to Dr. Nada Sharaf, Dr. Amal Yassien, Prof. Slim Abdennadher and Mr. Mostafa Yehia for their immense help, guidance and support throughout the project :)
